==========

An open source home automation framework.

This project will not be abandoned like so many bytes on the wire.
I have a few goals.

1. To create an RESTful API for interacting with the various home automation protocols in a standardized manner.
2. To create a service based architecture that can handle performing actions on triggers, or cron like scheduled events.
3. To create a plugin based architecture that makes it easy for others to add support for new devices, or protocols.
4. Documentation, documentation, documentation
5. Have fun.
